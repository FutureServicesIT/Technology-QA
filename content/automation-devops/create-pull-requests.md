title: Contributing a Pull Request?

## What is a Pull Request (PR)?

A pull request is a method of offering code changes to someone's code repository.

It allows the owners of the original repository to easily review the changes to code that you've made in your own copy. It allows both you and they to have a conversation to clarify any issues and make further changes if needed.

It then provides a very easy mechanism to merge your changes into the master if they are approved.

All the while, keeping track of all of the changes and the logs (text messages) you added to document each change.

## How do I contribute to a Git (or GitHub) repository?

If you have a contribution that you want to make to someone's Git repository, you do the following:

1. **Fork** the target repository (creates your own copy)
2. **Clone** your fork (creates a local copy from a cloud or remote host) if needed
3. Make your changes
4. **Commit** your changes to your local cloned fork
5. **Push** your local changes back to GitHub or similar cloud/remote hosting if needed
6. Create the **Pull Request** to ask the original repository to review your changes and **merge** them if they are acceptable.

The owner of the original then reviews your changes and, if they accept them, merges them into the original.

Whilst that will seem complex, it is quite straight-forward once you have done it once. In addition, you can keep the fork if you are likely to want to create more PR's. A fork is easily synchronised with the original so as to pick up any changes. Some simple tools such as _GitHub for Windows_ and _Visual Studio Code_ (a free editor) that understand Git will make life easy.

A repository is a store of information managed by Git. Git is simply the tool that manages the data behind the scenes. GitHub is a public database of Git repositories and makes it really easy to manage the information.
