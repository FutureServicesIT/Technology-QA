layout: post

## What kind of MFA we thinking of? (e.g. tokens, SMS)

Mobile. Mainly an app like the Microsoft or Google authenticator apps. With phone call or SMS as backup.

## is it MFA on o365 login, not the laptop?

The MFA is for Azure AD. This is used for BOTH laptop and O365 and other services as well via Azure SSO.

## will that SSO allow cross tenancy access (I assume that is going to be an important part of the requirement.design)
