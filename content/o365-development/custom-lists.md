title: How can I customise a list?

## Code free methods

Not much you can do without some code. Microsoft Flow may help in some cases, see the [article on Workflow](workflow) for more information.

You can also use PowerApps but this gives you more of a mobile-formatted view. It does enable you to customise the view, read-only form and the edit-form.

## Code light methods

You can fairly easily modify how a field looks in the column of a view by using the "Format Column" option in the drop-down menu of the column.
This lets you add [formatting encoded as JSON](http://o15.officeredir.microsoft.com/r/rlidOfficeWebHelp?p1=SPOStandard&clid=1033&ver=16&HelpID=WSSEndUser_ColumnFormatting). Basically a JSON'ised form of HTML.
